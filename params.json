{"name":"Jet","body":"Jet is an experimental JavaScript UI toolkit based on two premises:\r\n\r\n* Lower compatibility but small size and great performance\r\n* Not every feature out-of-the-box but great scalability\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is experimentation and learning, so feel free to use any part of Jet in your projects at your own risk. The status of the library is under development, not even an alpha stage. And since it is a learning project, you are very much welcome to provide suggestions, code and graphic design.","tagline":"Jet: Javascript Extensible Toolkit","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
